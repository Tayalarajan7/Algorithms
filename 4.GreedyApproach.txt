Greedy approach:
	Greedy approach is a simple approach which gives the optimal solution
most of the times. This is used in optimizing problems like finding minimum
or maximum in something.

It involves the below step:
* Choose a value which is immediately closer to the desired result.
* Break down the problem into similar sub problem based on the value choosen.
* Repeat the step till the globally optimal solution is arrived.

The choice made at each step is based on the past and not on future.
Once decision is made it does not look back and make appropriate changes
to its earlier decision. A decision made in this approach is final at each
step.

Similar to real life, a greedy decision looks at an immediate choice which
will take on step closer to the desired goal. This approach may fail badly
depending on the data.
