Divide and Conquer:
	Divide and Conquer algorithm is a very useful algorithm where you break
down the problems into subproblems and you solve the individual subproblem to
arrive at the final solution.

It involves these primary steps:
* Divide - Divide the problem into smaller and similar independent problems.
In other words, the subproblems should not repeat and they should be of the same
problem type as the original problem.

* Conquer - Solve the subproblem

* Combine - Combine solutions from the various subproblems to arrive at a final
solution.

Typically, Divide and Conquer is solved using recursion.
