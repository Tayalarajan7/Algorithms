Permutation:
* Import itertools package to implement the permutations method in python
* This method takes a list as an input and returns an object list of tuples that
contain all permutations in a list form.

# A Python program to print all
# permutations using library function
from itertools import permutations

# Get all permutations of [1, 2, 3]
perm = permutations([1, 2, 3])

# Print the obtained permutations
for i in list(perm):
	print (i)

Output:
(1, 2, 3)
(1, 3, 2)
(2, 1, 3)
(2, 3, 1)
(3, 1, 2)
(3, 2, 1)

# A Python program to print all
# permutations of given length
from itertools import permutations

# Get all permutations of length 2
# and length 2
perm = permutations([1, 2, 3], 2)

# Print the obtained permutations
for i in list(perm):
	print (i)

Output:
(1, 2)
(1, 3)
(2, 1)
(2, 3)
(3, 1)
(3, 2)
