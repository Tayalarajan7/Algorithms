Sliding Window:
	A sliding window is an abstract concept commonly used in array/string
problems.

	A window is a range of elements in the array/string which usually
defined by start and end indices, i.e,[i,j) (left-closed, right-open).

	A sliding window is a window "slides" its two boundries to the
certain direction.

	For example, if we slide [i, j)[i,j) to the right by 11 element, then it 
becomes [i+1, j+1)[i+1,j+1) (left-closed, right-open).
