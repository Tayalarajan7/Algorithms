Dynamic programming:
	Dynamic programming is a way of optimizing your solution by reusing the
results of older computation. In other words, the intermediate results are stored
for quick access, instead of being recomputed.

Dynamic programming is applicable where you can not only divide the problem
into smaller subproblems but those subproblems overlap. In other words in order
to solve one problem, you have to solve other problems.

In divide and conquer strategy, each subproblem was independent of the other.

Dynamic programming uses two steps:
* Recursively break down the problem into subproblems.
* Either use bottom-up or top-down approach to store the results of intermediate
problems.
